# random_sampling
Here, we have generated a synthetic population (N = $10^6$) for a distribution $y = mx + c$ where x âˆˆ (10,100), m =0.7 and c = -5. We have drawn 100, 1000 and
10000 random samples of each size 100 from this population and shown that distribution approaches the normal distribution as the number of random samples increases.
